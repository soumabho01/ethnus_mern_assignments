                The inline CSS style is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, you'll only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors. This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing your website may become too hard if you only use inline CSS. However, inline CSS in HTML can be useful in some situations. For example, in cases where you don't have access to CSS files or need to apply styles for a single element only. The disadvantage of inline CSS is that changes to inline CSS will affect only one specific element. With the inline CSS approach, you are not creating CSS rules, you are actually just adding CSS properties to HTML tags with the help of the style attribute and then give the property a value.

                The CSS code that we just wrote tells the CSS of our document that are you three patterns in a web page. Selector, Property, and value document loading faster. All other important parts of a web page are going to benefit from this and as a good developer you must understand the proper methods and best practices of each type of selector including Property name like font size, color, border, etc. If we consider patterns for a value of the font name like it should generally be font style or font family, so the font property. When you apply CSS, the property and value are going to be separated by a colon and each property are going to be separated by a semicolon. HTML code cannot be used to markup your pages, while CSS will style the pages including all parts of the different parts of the HTML element.

                In our HTML document, we need to define some rules that control how elements get displayed in order to solve the problem of defining what the result look of your document. You can style properties in many tables, headers, footers, etc, and other document defining blocks. It is not always practical to have CSS defined in the HTML document. Because one page of a website contains multiple HTML and also there may be separate CSS files to access CSS data. You can control external CSS files from the HTML tag. Your CSS files use the HTML tags to target a specific document with the external look of your document. You can use those patterns in these files contain text files. Hence, it is called CSS because it is capable of modifying the content.
