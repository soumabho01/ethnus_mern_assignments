    <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>

    <p>
        HTML (<i>Hypertext Markup Language</i>) is used to create document on the 
        <u>World Wide Web</u>. 
        <i>It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the 
        document to be displayed using a browser on Internet.</i> HTML was developed by 
        <b>Tim Berners-Lee</b> in 1992.
